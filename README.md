<b>*Tip: "CTRL + click" on the link to open in new tab. Github doesn't add target="_blank" to the link...</b>

<b>Idea:</b> <br/>
  to make UI here and data on other hosting as a headless WP

<b> Goals:</b> 
  1. To create portfolio site
  2. Learn and try animations
  3. Practise React, Git comand line, CSS, HTML, JS
  4. Learn and practice the work with remote server - WP, graphQL

<b> Reminder to me:</b> <br/>
Data (as headless WP) is in the GitHub repo of a user: 'someKindOfNickName'
